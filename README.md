# Virtual Animal Sounds

This project demonstrates the use of polymorphism and virtual functions in C++ through a simple simulation of different animal sounds. The program creates an array of `Animal` pointers and allows the user to populate it with various derived animal classes such as `Dog`, `Cat`, `Sheep`, `Cow`, and `Horse`. Each class overrides the `speak()` method to provide a specific sound.

## Features

- **Polymorphism**: Uses virtual functions to allow derived classes to override base class methods.
- **Dynamic Memory Management**: Demonstrates allocation and deallocation of memory for dynamic object creation.
- **User Interaction**: Provides a simple menu for the user to select different animal types.

## Compilation Instructions

To compile and run the file, follow these instructions:

1. **Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed** (e.g., g++, clang++).

2. **Compile the code** using the following command:
   ```bash
   g++ -o virtual_animal_sounds virtual_animal_sounds.cpp
3. **Run the executable with the following command:**
   ```bash
   ./virtual_animal_sounds
